<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios from scratch, focusing on iterative feature expansion and robust debugging. The core architecture comprises a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS. Initial work established CRUD operations for core entities and authentication. Subsequent phases introduced a detailed 8-room consultório map with complex scheduling, user management with role-based access, and comprehensive data seeding. Significant effort was dedicated to resolving a persistent real-time frontend slot synchronization bug, which involved multiple phases of refactoring, including a complete rewrite of the slot rendering logic to a backend-driven approach and meticulous timezone handling. The final stages addressed dynamic operating hours configuration and preparation for a free Railway deployment. The process reflects a resilient problem-solving approach, adapting architecture to user feedback and deep-diving into complex state and data flow issues.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary request was to develop a deployable Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios. The application needed to provide core management functionalities including CRUD operations for Patients, Doctors, and Appointments, alongside a dashboard for key statistics. A detailed consultório management module was required, encompassing 8 specific rooms (5 fixed, 3 rotative) with precise weekly schedules, specializations (ESF, Cardiology, Acupuncture, Pediatrics, Gynecology, E-Multi, Support), and operating hours, alongside intelligent conflict validation. User management with role-based access (Admin, Médico, Recepção) was essential for security and UI visibility. The system also required pre-population with realistic sample data. A critical and recurring challenge was the real-time visual update of appointment slots on the frontend (e.g., color changing from green to red upon booking) without a page refresh, which necessitated extensive debugging and architectural changes. Finally, the ability to dynamically configure consultório operating hours via the UI was added.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Gunicorn.
-   **Frontend**: React (UI library), Tailwind CSS (styling), Axios (API calls).
-   **Infrastructure**: Supervisor (process manager), Kubernetes Ingress rules (API routing), Docker, Nginx.
-   **Development**: Yarn (Node.js package manager),  (Python for time logic).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a full-stack architecture, composed of a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   : This is the central file for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Defines all API endpoints, including authentication, CRUD for various entities, and complex logic for managing consultorio availability and appointments.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significant changes include: fixing datetime comparison errors; reordering routes; implementing a **new endpoint ** to process and return pre-calculated slot availability for the frontend, making the backend the single source of truth; adding robust validation for appointment creation based on consultorio operating hours (now dynamically fetched from DB); correcting timezone handling to GMT-3 for consistency; and adding a  endpoint for dynamically updating consultorio hours in the database. A  endpoint was added for deployment.

-   : The primary React component.
    -   **Importance**: Responsible for the application's overall structure, state management, and user interface, handling navigation and API interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Received extensive modifications to integrate all features. Key corrections involved standardizing API payload field names, re-enabling buttons, and, critically, ensuring state consistency for real-time updates. This involved refining  and  functions to process data consistently, passing  as a prop to the appointment modal, and implementing  to call a refresh method on  after successful appointment creation. Error handling for API responses (e.g., 409 conflicts) was also improved. A new  component was integrated for editing consultorio hours.

-   : A specialized React component for rendering time slots.
    -   **Importance**: Visually represents time slot availability and status.
    -   **Changes Made**: Underwent a **complete re-architecture** to consume simplified, pre-processed slot data directly from the new backend  endpoint. This drastically reduced frontend logic. It now uses  and  to expose a  function, allowing  to trigger real-time re-fetching and visual updates after appointments are created or canceled. Its rendering logic was adjusted to accurately display past, available, and occupied slots (grey, green, red respectively) based on backend data.

-   : A Python script to clear and populate the MongoDB database.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures a consistent and functional initial state for the application's demonstration and testing.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to align with evolving data models, specifically incorporating  and  into consultorio documents. It was frequently used during debugging to reset the database.

-   : A markdown file for tracking testing results and progress.
    -   **Importance**: Serves as a critical communication and progress tracking log, detailing user problem statements, testing outcomes, and root cause analyses.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated throughout the development trajectory to reflect debugging steps, findings, and the resolution of various issues, including frontend synchronization, backend validation, and timezone problems.

-   : New file for Railway deployment configuration.
    -   **Importance**: Specifies the service name, Dockerfile location, and environment variables for Railway's build and deploy process.
    

-   : New file for building a Docker image of the application.
    -   **Importance**: Provides instructions for creating a reproducible and portable container environment for the application, bundling both frontend and backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Configured to install Python and Node.js dependencies, copy application code, and use Supervisor to run both services.

-   : New file for Supervisor process management.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures both the FastAPI backend (running via Gunicorn) and the React frontend are managed and kept running within the Docker container.
    -   **Changes Made**: Defines program entries for  and , specifying their command, working directory, and stdout/stderr logs.

-   : New file for Nginx web server configuration.
    -   **Importance**: Acts as a reverse proxy, serving the static React frontend files and routing API requests to the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Configured to listen on port 80, serve frontend assets, and proxy requests prefixed with  to the backend running on port 8001.

-   : Project documentation.
    -   **Importance**: Provides an overview of the project.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to reflect the completion of the project and information regarding deployment on Railway.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Application Deployment**: The primary pending task is to guide the user through the deployment of the application to a free hosting solution, specifically Railway, as the functional development is considered complete.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on preparing the Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios for deployment to a free hosting platform, Railway. The AI engineer has recently completed a comprehensive set of fixes ensuring all core functionalities are robust and consistent:

1.  **Backend Timezone and Slot Logic**: The backend now correctly handles GMT-3 timezone for slot generation and appointment validation. The  endpoint is the single source of truth, returning fully processed slot information (, , ).
2.  **Dynamic Consultório Hours**: Consultorio operating hours (, ) are no longer hardcoded but stored and managed dynamically via the database, with a new backend API endpoint and a frontend UI for editing these hours.
3.  **Real-time Frontend Synchronization**: Appointment slots visually update in real-time (green/red) after successful booking or cancellation, achieved by using  and  in  and triggering a refresh from  after API calls.
4.  **Robust Error Handling**: Frontend now displays clear messages for API errors (e.g., 409 Conflict) and reloads slots to reflect the true state from the backend.
5.  **Data Consistency**: Backend validations prevent creating appointments outside operating hours, and previous inconsistent data has been cleaned up.

The project has been packaged for Railway deployment, with , , , and  files created. The AI engineer is currently guiding the user through the first step of this deployment: creating a Railway account.
