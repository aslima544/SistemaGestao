The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios from an initial empty repository, iteratively addressing evolving user requirements. The core strategy involved building a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS. Initial development focused on setting up the environment, core CRUD for patients, doctors, and appointments, and authentication. Subsequent phases expanded functionality to include a detailed, 8-room consultório map with fixed and rotational schedules, and a comprehensive user management module with role-based access. Significant debugging efforts were made to resolve inconsistencies in frontend field names during appointment creation, address backend datetime comparison errors causing network issues, and correct visual synchronization of appointment slots, specifically for real-time updates. The process highlights an iterative development approach, where features were built, tested, and refined based on direct user feedback and identified bugs, demonstrating robust problem-solving, particularly in handling data flow and UI synchronization challenges.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary request was to develop a deployable Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios (Consultation Management System). Starting from an empty project, the application grew to encompass:
1.  **Core Management**: CRUD operations for Patients, Doctors, and Appointments.
2.  **Dashboard**: Provides key statistics and a visual overview.
3.  **Consultório Management**: Full CRUD for consultation rooms, including intelligent conflict validation during appointment scheduling.
4.  **Detailed Room Map**: Implementation of 8 specific rooms (5 fixed, 3 rotative) with a precise weekly schedule, including specializations (ESF, Cardiology, Acupuncture, Pediatrics, Gynecology, E-Multi, Support) and specific operating hours, integrating concepts like Visita Domiciliar and Médico Apoio.
5.  **User Management**: A dedicated Usuários tab with CRUD functionality for different user roles (Admin, Médico, Recepção), enforced security, and role-based UI visibility.
6.  **Data Population**: The system required pre-population with realistic sample data for doctors, patients, consultórios, and appointments to demonstrate full functionality.
7.  **Real-time Updates**: Crucially, appointment slots in the frontend must visually update (e.g., color change) immediately upon booking without page refresh. The current state reflects an ongoing issue where backend bookings are successful but frontend slots don't visually reflect the occupied status.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
-   **Frontend**: React (UI library), Tailwind CSS (styling), Axios (API calls).
-   **Infrastructure**: Supervisor (process manager), Kubernetes Ingress rules (API routing).
-   **Development**: Yarn (Node.js package manager).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a full-stack architecture, composed of a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   : This is the central file for the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for authentication, CRUD operations (Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Consultorios, Users), and implements the complex logic for consultorio availability and weekly schedules.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially created from scratch. Models and routes for various entities were progressively added. Key modifications include reordering FastAPI routes to prevent conflicts (e.g.,  capturing ), and fixing a  by normalizing datetime objects before comparison in appointment conflict validation.
-   : The primary React component responsible for the application's overall structure, state management, and user interface. It handles navigation, API interactions, and renders different views like the dashboard, patient/doctor/consultorio/user lists, and the appointment modal.
    -   **Changes Made**: Started as a basic React app. Extensively modified to integrate all features: dashboards, forms for creating and editing entities, and display logic for lists and the detailed consultorio map. Corrections involved standardizing API payload field names (, , , ), enabling the Nova Consulta button, and attempts to ensure state consistency for real-time updates (managing  and  states).
-   : A specialized React component responsible for rendering the visual representation of time slots for each consultório. It determines and displays the availability (color-coded) of each slot based on existing appointments.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to correctly parse  (an ISO string from the API) into JavaScript  objects. This allowed accurate extraction of time and duration to correctly identify occupied slots and apply the appropriate red (occupied), green (available), or gray (past) visual styling.
-   : A new Python script.
    -   **Purpose**: Created to programmatically clear the MongoDB database and then populate it with a comprehensive set of sample users (admin, doctor, reception), doctors (ESF, specialists), patients with historical data, fixed and rotative consultorios (C1-C8), and sample appointments to fully demonstrate the application's features from a clean state.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Real-time Slot Update**: The main pending task is to debug and resolve why appointment slots in the Consultórios tab do not visually update to occupied (red color) in real-time immediately after an appointment is successfully created, despite the backend confirming the booking and the underlying data being correct.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on a persistent frontend synchronization issue where appointment slots do not visually update in real-time after a successful booking.
**Problem Description**: When a user schedules an appointment, the backend correctly registers it and prevents duplicate bookings (e.g., for C3 at 14:30). However, the corresponding slot on the frontend, specifically within the Consultórios tab, remains visually green (available) instead of turning red (occupied), necessitating a manual page refresh to see the change.

**Previous AI's Actions to Address This**:
1.  **Backend Conflict Validation**: The AI previously fixed a  and an incorrect logic in  related to  comparisons and the MongoDB query for appointment conflicts. This ensures the backend correctly handles timezones and accurately identifies occupied slots.
2.  **Frontend Field Name Consistency**: Corrected various inconsistent field names ( to ,  to ,  to ) in  to ensure the correct data payload was sent to the API.
3.  **Nova Consulta Button**: Re-enabled the Nova Consulta button on the dashboard in .
4.  ** Logic**: Modified  to correctly parse  from the API response (ISO string) into  objects, extracting hours and durations to accurately determine slot occupancy and apply visual colors.
5.  **State Synchronization Attempt**: The AI attempted to ensure both  and  states in  were updated by calling  and  after successful appointment creation, aiming for real-time visual updates.

**Current Nuance**: While the backend is robustly preventing double bookings (confirming it knows the slot is occupied), the frontend's visual state for that specific slot doesn't update, leading to a confusing user experience where a visually available slot cannot be booked due to a backend already occupied error. The last test involved successfully booking C3 14:30 for tomorrow from the backend, but the frontend's visual state did not change.
