# Sistema de GestÃ£o de ConsultÃ³rios - Testing Protocol

## Testing Protocol
- Always MUST READ this file before invoking testing agents
- Test backend first using deep_testing_backend_v2
- After backend testing, ask user permission before testing frontend
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents
- Update this file with findings and next steps

## Current Investigation: C3 14:30 Slot Not Updating Visually

### Problem Statement
When a user schedules an appointment for C3 at 14:30, the backend correctly registers it and prevents duplicate bookings, but the frontend slot remains visually "green" (available) instead of turning "red" (occupied), requiring manual page refresh.

### Investigation Status
âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed frontend state synchronization issue

### Root Cause Found
The issue was in the `handleCreateAppointment` and `onCancelarAgendamento` functions in App.js. After creating/canceling appointments, the `agendamentos` state was being updated with raw API data, but the ConsultorioSlots component expected processed data with `horario`, `data`, and `duration` fields.

### Solution Implemented
Fixed inconsistent data processing in App.js:
- Updated `handleCreateAppointment` (lines 531-560) to process appointment data consistently
- Updated `onCancelarAgendamento` (lines 562-586) to maintain same data format
- Both functions now apply the same data transformation as the useEffect (lines 236-244)

### Code Changes Made
1. **App.js handleCreateAppointment**: Added data processing to match useEffect format
2. **App.js onCancelarAgendamento**: Added consistent data processing
3. Both functions now transform API response data before calling setAgendamentos()

### Testing History
- âœ… Backend testing completed - backend working correctly (no issues)
- âœ… Frontend fix implemented - state synchronization corrected
- âœ… System accessibility confirmed - login and dashboard working
- ðŸ”„ Manual testing needed to confirm slot visual updates work in real-time

### Next Steps
1. Manual verification that C3 14:30 slot now updates to red immediately after appointment creation
2. Test with other time slots to ensure fix is general
3. Verify canceled appointments immediately free up slots visually

## Incorporate User Feedback
User reported: "slot C3 14:30 nÃ£o atualiza para vermelho apÃ³s criaÃ§Ã£o do agendamento, mesmo com o agendamento existindo no backend"

**Status**: Problem identified and fixed. Solution targets real-time visual updates without page refresh.
