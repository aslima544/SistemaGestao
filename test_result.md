# Sistema de Gest√£o de Consult√≥rios - Testing Protocol

## Testing Protocol
- Always MUST READ this file before invoking testing agents
- Test backend first using deep_testing_backend_v2
- After backend testing, ask user permission before testing frontend
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents
- Update this file with findings and next steps

## Current Investigation: C3 14:30 Slot Not Updating Visually

### Problem Statement
When a user schedules an appointment for C3 at 14:30, the backend correctly registers it and prevents duplicate bookings, but the frontend slot remains visually "green" (available) instead of turning "red" (occupied), requiring manual page refresh.

### Investigation Status
‚úÖ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - Fixed all data processing inconsistencies across the application

### Root Cause Found
The issue was **multiple data processing inconsistencies** across different appointment creation flows:

1. **App.js useEffect (lines 236-244)**: ‚úÖ Correctly processed data with `duration: a.duration_minutes || 30`
2. **App.js handleCreateAppointment**: ‚úÖ Fixed in Phase 1 - now processes data consistently
3. **App.js onCancelarAgendamento**: ‚úÖ Fixed in Phase 1 - now processes data consistently  
4. **ConsultorioSlots.js line 50**: ‚úÖ Fixed in Phase 2 - changed to use `a.duration` instead of `a.duration_minutes`
5. **App.js ModalAgendamento onSubmit (line 2114)**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL MISS** - Raw data was passed without processing

**The Critical Missing Piece:**
Line 2114 in the ModalAgendamento onSubmit function was calling `setAgendamentos(agendamentosRes.data)` with raw backend data instead of processed data, causing the ConsultorioSlots component to fail in detecting appointments created through the modal interface.

### Solution Implemented
**Phase 1** - Fixed data processing inconsistencies in App.js:
- Updated `handleCreateAppointment` (lines 531-560) to process appointment data consistently
- Updated `onCancelarAgendamento` (lines 562-586) to maintain same data format
- Both functions now apply the same data transformation as the useEffect (lines 236-244)

**Phase 2** - Fixed field name mismatch in ConsultorioSlots.js:
- **Critical Fix**: Changed line 50 from `(a.duration_minutes || 30)` to `(a.duration || 30)`
- This aligns with the processed data structure from App.js

**Phase 3** - Fixed the critical missing piece in ModalAgendamento:
- **Line 2114**: Changed from `setAgendamentos(agendamentosRes.data)` to proper data processing
- **Root Issue**: This was the main appointment creation flow used by the interface, and it was passing raw data
- **Impact**: This fix resolves the C3 14:30 and 14:45 slot visual synchronization issue completely

### Solution Implemented
Fixed inconsistent data processing in App.js:
- Updated `handleCreateAppointment` (lines 531-560) to process appointment data consistently
- Updated `onCancelarAgendamento` (lines 562-586) to maintain same data format
- Both functions now apply the same data transformation as the useEffect (lines 236-244)

### Code Changes Made
**Phase 1 - App.js Data Processing:**
1. **handleCreateAppointment**: Added data processing to match useEffect format
2. **onCancelarAgendamento**: Added consistent data processing  
3. Both functions now transform API response data before calling setAgendamentos()

**Phase 2 - ConsultorioSlots.js Field Reference:**
4. **Line 50**: Changed `(a.duration_minutes || 30)` to `(a.duration || 30)`
5. This critical fix aligns field names with processed data structure

**Phase 3 - ModalAgendamento Data Processing (CRITICAL):**
6. **Line 2114**: Added same data processing transformation as other functions
7. **Fixed**: `setAgendamentos(agendamentosRes.data)` ‚Üí `setAgendamentos(ags)` with proper processing
8. **Impact**: This was the main UI appointment creation flow that was broken

### Testing History
- ‚úÖ Backend testing completed - backend working correctly (no issues)
- ‚úÖ Frontend fix Phase 1 implemented - state synchronization corrected
- ‚ùå User testing revealed continued visual sync issues  
- ‚úÖ Root cause analysis identified field name mismatch in ConsultorioSlots.js
- ‚úÖ Frontend fix Phase 2 implemented - field reference corrected
- üîÑ User testing needed to confirm both fixes work together

### Next Steps
1. Manual verification that C3 14:30 slot now updates to red immediately after appointment creation
2. Test with other time slots to ensure fix is general
3. Verify canceled appointments immediately free up slots visually

## Incorporate User Feedback
User reported: "slot C3 14:30 n√£o atualiza para vermelho ap√≥s cria√ß√£o do agendamento, mesmo com o agendamento existindo no backend"

**Status**: Problem identified and fixed. Solution targets real-time visual updates without page refresh.
