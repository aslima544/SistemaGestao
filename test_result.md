# Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios - Testing Protocol

## Testing Protocol
- Always MUST READ this file before invoking testing agents
- Test backend first using deep_testing_backend_v2
- After backend testing, ask user permission before testing frontend
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents
- Update this file with findings and next steps

## Current Investigation: C3 14:30 Slot Not Updating Visually

### Problem Statement
When a user schedules an appointment for C3 at 14:30, the backend correctly registers it and prevents duplicate bookings, but the frontend slot remains visually "green" (available) instead of turning "red" (occupied), requiring manual page refresh.

### Investigation Status
✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED - Backend is working correctly

### Testing History
- **2025-08-07 16:17** - Backend testing completed by testing agent
  - ✅ C3 14:30 appointment creation tested
  - ✅ Conflict detection working properly
  - ✅ Database persistence verified
  - ✅ API endpoints returning correct data
  - ✅ General backend functionality: 19/20 tests passed

### Backend Test Results
**C3 14:30 Specific Tests:**
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ C3 consultorio found (08:00-17:00 schedule)
- ✅ Existing appointments detected (4 total C3 appointments)
- ✅ 14:30 slot already occupied (conflict detection working)
- ✅ Backend prevents duplicate bookings (409 Conflict response)
- ✅ Alternative time slots work (15:00 appointment created)
- ✅ Appointments saved correctly in database
- ✅ API endpoints return appointment data
- ✅ Cleanup operations successful

**General Backend Tests:**
- ✅ Health check, authentication, user management
- ✅ Patient CRUD operations
- ✅ Doctor CRUD operations  
- ✅ Consultorio management and scheduling
- ✅ Appointment creation and conflict detection
- ✅ Dashboard statistics
- ❌ Minor: Update appointment endpoint not implemented (non-critical)

### Root Cause Analysis
**Backend Status: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY**
- Appointment creation works properly
- Conflict detection prevents duplicate bookings
- Data persistence is functioning
- API endpoints return correct information

**Issue Location: 🔍 FRONTEND**
The problem is confirmed to be frontend-related:
- Backend correctly prevents duplicate bookings
- Frontend visual state not updating after appointment creation
- Requires manual page refresh to show updated slot status

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Backend testing completed - no issues found
2. 🔄 Frontend testing required (pending user permission)
3. 🔍 Debug frontend state management and re-rendering logic
4. 🔍 Check ConsultorioSlots.js component updates

### Agent Communication
- **Testing Agent (2025-08-07 16:17)**: Backend functionality verified working correctly. C3 14:30 slot conflict detection working as expected. Issue confirmed to be frontend visual state update problem. Ready for frontend testing with user permission.

## Incorporate User Feedback
User is experiencing: "slot C3 14:30 não atualiza para vermelho após criação do agendamento, mesmo com o agendamento existindo no backend"

**Confirmed**: Backend is working correctly. Focus needed on frontend real-time visual updates without page refresh.
