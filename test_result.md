# Sistema de GestÃ£o de ConsultÃ³rios - Testing Protocol

## Testing Protocol
- Always MUST READ this file before invoking testing agents
- Test backend first using deep_testing_backend_v2
- After backend testing, ask user permission before testing frontend
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents
- Update this file with findings and next steps

## Current Investigation: C3 14:30 Slot Not Updating Visually

### Problem Statement
When a user schedules an appointment for C3 at 14:30, the backend correctly registers it and prevents duplicate bookings, but the frontend slot remains visually "green" (available) instead of turning "red" (occupied), requiring manual page refresh.

### Investigation Status
âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed frontend state synchronization issue

### Root Cause Found
The issue was a **data structure mismatch** between App.js and ConsultorioSlots.js:

1. **App.js Data Processing**: Functions like `handleCreateAppointment` and `onCancelarAgendamento` process API data and rename `duration_minutes` to `duration`
2. **ConsultorioSlots.js Expectation**: Component still referenced `a.duration_minutes` (line 50) instead of `a.duration`
3. **Result**: Duration calculations defaulted to 30 minutes for all appointments, causing incorrect slot occupancy detection

### Solution Implemented
**Phase 1** - Fixed data processing inconsistencies in App.js:
- Updated `handleCreateAppointment` (lines 531-560) to process appointment data consistently
- Updated `onCancelarAgendamento` (lines 562-586) to maintain same data format
- Both functions now apply the same data transformation as the useEffect (lines 236-244)

**Phase 2** - Fixed field name mismatch in ConsultorioSlots.js:
- **Critical Fix**: Changed line 50 from `(a.duration_minutes || 30)` to `(a.duration || 30)`
- This aligns with the processed data structure from App.js

### Solution Implemented
Fixed inconsistent data processing in App.js:
- Updated `handleCreateAppointment` (lines 531-560) to process appointment data consistently
- Updated `onCancelarAgendamento` (lines 562-586) to maintain same data format
- Both functions now apply the same data transformation as the useEffect (lines 236-244)

### Code Changes Made
**Phase 1 - App.js Data Processing:**
1. **handleCreateAppointment**: Added data processing to match useEffect format
2. **onCancelarAgendamento**: Added consistent data processing
3. Both functions now transform API response data before calling setAgendamentos()

**Phase 2 - ConsultorioSlots.js Field Reference:**
4. **Line 50**: Changed `(a.duration_minutes || 30)` to `(a.duration || 30)`
5. This critical fix aligns field names with processed data structure

### Testing History
- âœ… Backend testing completed - backend working correctly (no issues)
- âœ… Frontend fix implemented - state synchronization corrected
- âœ… System accessibility confirmed - login and dashboard working
- ðŸ”„ Manual testing needed to confirm slot visual updates work in real-time

### Next Steps
1. Manual verification that C3 14:30 slot now updates to red immediately after appointment creation
2. Test with other time slots to ensure fix is general
3. Verify canceled appointments immediately free up slots visually

## Incorporate User Feedback
User reported: "slot C3 14:30 nÃ£o atualiza para vermelho apÃ³s criaÃ§Ã£o do agendamento, mesmo com o agendamento existindo no backend"

**Status**: Problem identified and fixed. Solution targets real-time visual updates without page refresh.
