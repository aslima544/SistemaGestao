# Test Results and Protocol

## Original User Problem Statement
Medical Office Management System (Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios) deployment and functionality issues:
- Backend deployed on Railway but missing full API endpoints (404 errors)
- Frontend consultation slots not updating visually 
- Authentication works but other endpoints return 404
- Need full CRUD operations for Patients, Doctors, Appointments
- Consultation room management with 8-room system

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Protocol
1. MUST test backend first using `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent
2. Test all API endpoints: auth, patients, doctors, appointments, consultorios, procedures
3. Verify MongoDB Atlas connection and data access
4. Check JWT authentication flow
5. Validate CRUD operations functionality

### Frontend Testing Protocol  
1. ONLY test frontend AFTER backend testing is complete
2. MUST ask user permission before frontend testing using `ask_human` tool
3. Test authentication flow, navigation, data display
4. Verify consultation slots visual updates
5. Test complete user workflows

### Communication Protocol with Testing Sub-agents
- Provide clear objectives and expected outcomes
- Include relevant context about the medical office management system
- Specify which endpoints/features to focus on
- Request detailed feedback on any failures or issues

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User reports 404 errors on endpoints like /api/procedimentos and /api/appointments after successful login
- Backend deployment on Railway may be using simplified version instead of full server.py
- Frontend deployed separately and configured to use Railway backend URL
- All data successfully migrated to MongoDB Atlas (58 documents)

## Test Results

### Current Status
- Backend running locally on port 8001 with full server.py
- Deprecation warning about on_event vs lifespan handlers
- Railway deployment status needs verification

### Issues to Address
1. Ensure Railway deployment uses full server.py with all endpoints
2. Fix consultation slots visual update in ConsultorioSlots.js  
3. Verify all API endpoints work correctly
4. Test end-to-end application workflow
